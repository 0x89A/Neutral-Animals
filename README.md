Animals will not attack anything unless they are attacked first, then if the animal loses sight of its last attacker for more than 30 seconds (default), it will forget.

## Permissions
* `neutralanimals.use` - those without this permission will not be affected by this plugin and will always experience default behaviour.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "Animal forget time": 30.0
}
```

## Notes
Thanks to `titanium47` for suggesting this plugin.
